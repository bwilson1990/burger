# Eat Da Burger

### Overview

Our assignment was to create a burger logger using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and our own ORM. The objective was to allow a user to type in a burger of their choice, hit the add button and log it to a database. The user can then hit the "Devour It" button and move the item into the "Burgers Eaten" column/database.
